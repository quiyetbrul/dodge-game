# dodge-game

An IDE that supports Java is required to run this game.
I use NetBeans 8.1 IDE https://netbeans.org/community/releases/33/README.html

~
Game Instruction:
Use the WASD keys to dodge the enemies.

Improvements to be made:

1. High score - prompt the player to input a name if a new high score is achieved.
2. Audio - audio is played in the background, during collision, mouse clicks, etc.
3. Player upgrades - player is able to upgrade speed, character size, health bar, etc.
4. Sprites - a better UI/UX game with inclusion of illustrations
